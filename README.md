# Traveling Salesman Problem Solver

This project implements three search algorithms to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP): Breadth-First Search (BFS), Least-Cost Search, and A* Search.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**.
2. **Open the project in Visual Studio**.
3. **Set the filename path**:

Open main.cpp and update the file path in the following line:
string directoryPath = "C:\\Users\\Alejandro\\Desktop\\ConsoleApplication1\\";
Replace it with the directory where you saved the input files.
4.**Build and run the project**.
5.**Enter the filename when prompted (e.g., lin105.txt or lin318.txt)**.
The program will calculate and display the optimal path and cost using the three search algorithms.
